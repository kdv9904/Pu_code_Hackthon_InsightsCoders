# 🏪 Local Vendor Automation (VendorConnect)
### AI + Real-Time Location-Based Platform for Street Vendors & Local Businesses

**Local Vendor Automation (VendorConnect)** is a real-time, location-aware digital platform that connects **verified street vendors** with **nearby customers**.  
It provides vendors with a live digital presence while enabling customers to discover, track, and pre-book products from trusted vendors in real time.

This project also includes **AI-powered automation features** such as **OCR-based authentication**, **image classification using transfer learning**, and a **custom RAG chatbot** for smart query answering.

## ⭐ Key Highlights
- 📍 Real-time vendor location tracking & nearby discovery
- ✅ Admin-verified onboarding with secure authentication
- 🔍 OCR-based document authentication using **EasyOCR**
- 🖼 Product image classification using **Transfer Learning**
- 💬 Custom **RAG chatbot** for vendor/product query answering
- ⚡ Built using **Microservices Architecture (Spring Boot + Eureka + Feign)**
- 🔔 Real-time notifications for customers and vendors

---

## 🚀 Vision
To digitally empower street vendors and local businesses by giving them a **real-time, location-based digital identity** and enabling direct, transparent, and instant connections with customers.

## 👨‍💻 My Role (AI/ML Developer Contribution)
As an **AI/ML Developer**, my contributions focused on automation and intelligent features:

- Developed an **OCR-based vendor authentication module** using **EasyOCR** to extract and validate vendor document details.
- Built a **product image classification model** using **Transfer Learning** to automatically categorize vendor products.
- Implemented a **custom RAG chatbot** that answers customer queries using vendor/product data.
- Collaborated with backend and frontend team members to integrate AI features into the overall system.

📌 These features helped reduce manual verification effort, improved onboarding speed, and enhanced customer experience.

- Receive and manage customer pre-bookings
- Notify nearby customers when arriving at a new location

### Customers can:
- Discover verified vendors nearby
- View live vendor locations on a map
- Browse real-time product availability
- Pre-book items before visiting
- Receive instant notifications when vendors arrive nearby

## 🤖 AI/ML Automation Features (Major Contribution)

### 🔍 OCR-based Vendor Authentication (EasyOCR)
To streamline vendor onboarding and authentication, an OCR module was implemented using **EasyOCR**.

**What it does:**
- Extracts text from uploaded vendor documents (ID proof / license / certificates)
- Automatically reads fields like name, ID number, etc.
- Helps reduce manual verification time for admins

**Impact:**
- Faster vendor verification
- Reduced manual effort in authentication process
- Improved onboarding automation

---

### 🖼 Product Image Classification (Transfer Learning)
A product image classification model was built using **Transfer Learning** to categorize vendor products automatically.

**Use case:**
- Vendors upload product images
- System predicts the product category (e.g., fruits, vegetables, grocery items)

**Benefits:**
- Improves product listing speed
- Reduces manual categorization work
- Enhances customer browsing and filtering

---

### 💬 Custom RAG Chatbot (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
A custom **RAG-based chatbot** was developed to answer customer questions based on platform data.

**Example queries supported:**
- “Which vendors sell tomatoes nearby?”
- “Show me vendors with best ratings”
- “What is the price of milk today?”
- “Which vendor is currently online near my location?”

**How it helps:**
- Smart and fast customer support
- More accurate responses than normal chatbot
- Improves engagement and user experience

---

## 🧪 Real-World Use Cases
- Vendors broadcast live location and available products to nearby customers.
- Customers pre-book items before visiting a vendor.
- Vendors send real-time alerts when moving to a new location.
- Customers receive instant notifications with pricing and availability details.
- Admin verifies vendors using OCR-extracted details.
- Product images are auto-classified to speed up listing.

---

## ⚠ Challenges & Considerations
- Continuous internet and GPS access required.
- Vendor onboarding may take time due to verification.
- Digital literacy challenges for some vendors.
- Battery and location accuracy management on mobile devices.
